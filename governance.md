# Project Governance and Management

## Project Mission
My aim is to develop a high-quality options arbitrage finder with both imperative and functional implementations that accurately identifies risk-free profit opportunities in options markets.

## Individual Roles and Responsibilities
As the sole developer on this project, I manage all aspects of the development process:

- Project coordination and timeline management
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Development of both C++ (imperative) and Haskell (functional) implementations
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation creation and maintenance
- Performance analysis and optimization

## Self-Management Approach
- Regular work sessions: Scheduled blocks of focused development time
- Milestone planning: Breaking the project into manageable chunks with deadlines
- Self-reviews: Regular code reviews of my own work to maintain quality

## Development Workflow
1. Design phase: Planning of ADT's and search algorithms
2. C++ implementation phase: Development of the imperative solution
3. Initial testing phase for C++ solution: Initial testing to verify correct operation of ADT's 
   and search algorithms
4. Haskell implementation phase: Development of the functional solution
5. Initial testing phase for Haskell solution: Initial testing to verify correct operation of ADT's 
   and search algorithms
6. Comparative testing phase: Testing C++ version against Haskell version to ensure equal results
7. Optimization phase: Creating incrementally more optimized versions of C++ and Haskell versions in parallel
7. Documentation phase: Completing all required documentation

## Version Control Strategy
I will use Git for version control.

## Testing Strategy

My testing approach is built around dedicated test modules for both implementations, specifically designed to verify the correctness of the Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and the core algorithm:

### 1. ADT Testing
I created dedicated test modules for both implementations:

- **TestADT.cpp**: A C++ module that focuses on testing the core ADTs:
  - Tests Option creation and properties
  - Verifies OptionChain functionality (adding options, retrieving by strike)
  - Tests OptionLeg cost calculations
  - Validates Problem representation and solution detection
  - Specifically tests the box spread arbitrage scenario to confirm algorithm correctness

- **TestADT.hs**: A Haskell module (equivalent to TestADT.hs) that:
  - Tests the Haskell implementations of the same core ADTs
  - Verifies consistency between the C++ and Haskell implementations
  - Validates the detection of arbitrage opportunities

### 2. Testing Framework
For both implementations, I use a consistent testing methodology:
- Build test option chains with specific arbitrage opportunities
- Verify correct identification of arbitrage opportunities
- Testing using example .txt files
- Verification that file parsing correctly populates data structures
- Confirmation that solutions are correctly identified and output

### 4. Performance Testing
- Both implementations include timing measurements
- Multiple iterations to get reliable performance data
- Comparison between C++ and Haskell implementations

## Quality Assurance Process
1. Regular self-review of code
2. Systematic manual testing with documented test cases
3. Performance benchmarking with both small and large datasets
4. Thorough documentation review
5. Code refactoring for clarity and maintainability

## Backup and Recovery Protocols
1. All code is committed to version control daily
2. Local backups are made after each development session
3. Weekly self-email of local backup
